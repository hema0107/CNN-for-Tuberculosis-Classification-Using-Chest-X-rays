# CNN-for-Tuberculosis-Classification-Using-Chest-X-rays.
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to X-ray images enhanced with Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of 3500 normal X-rays and 700 TB-positive X-rays, highlighting a class imbalance that was addressed through data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, horizontal flipping, and color jittering to enhance model generalization. CLAHE was applied to improve contrast in X-ray images, preventing over-amplification of noise and enhancing visibility in uneven lighting conditions.

Three CNN architectures—EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2—were trained using two epoch configurations (5 and 10 epochs) with an 80:20 train-validation split. EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 were used as feature extractors with custom classification heads, while MobileNetV2, known for its lightweight and efficient design, was also implemented with a custom head. The evaluation results demonstrated that MobileNetV2 consistently achieved validation accuracy above 99%, outperforming the other two models in both epoch settings. Given its superior accuracy and computational efficiency, MobileNetV2 emerges as the most suitable model for real-world implementation, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings.
